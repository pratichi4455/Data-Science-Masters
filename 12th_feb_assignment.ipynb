    "An exception in Python is an abnormal event that occurs during the execution of a program, disrupting the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception occurs, the interpreter raises an exception object, which can then be caught and handled by appropriate code. Exceptions can occur for various reasons, such as dividing by zero, trying to access an index that doesn't exist, or attempting to open a file that doesn't exist.\n",

    "Nature of Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception: Exceptions occur during the runtime of a program. They are unexpected events that disrupt the normal flow of the program.\n",
    "Syntax Error: Syntax errors, on the other hand, occur during the parsing of the program. They are errors in the structure of the code and prevent the interpreter from understanding or executing the program.\n",
    "Timing of Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception: Exceptions are detected during the runtime when the program is actually executing.\n",
    "Syntax Error: Syntax errors are detected during the parsing phase, before the program begins execution.\n",
    "Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception: Exceptions can be caught and handled using try, except, finally, and else blocks. This allows for graceful error handling and recovery.\n",
    "Syntax Error: Syntax errors cannot be caught or handled during runtime. They must be fixed before the program is executed."
