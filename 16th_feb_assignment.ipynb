    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way to easily access, manage, and update information. It is essentially a repository for storing and managing data in a systematic manner, making it easier to retrieve and manipulate information as needed. Databases are crucial components of modern software applications, powering everything from simple websites to complex enterprise systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main categories of databases: SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL). Here's a differentiation between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured Data Model: SQL databases are based on a structured data model, where data is stored in tables with rows and columns. This model is also known as the relational model.\n",
    "Schema: SQL databases typically enforce a rigid schema, meaning the structure of the data (table definitions, data types, constraints) must be defined before data can be stored. Changes to the schema can be complex and may require downtime.\n",
    "ACID Transactions: SQL databases provide ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, ensuring that database transactions are processed reliably even in the event of failures.\n",
    "Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite.\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Data Model: NoSQL databases support various data models, such as document, key-value, columnar, or graph-based, offering more flexibility in handling unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "Schema Flexibility: NoSQL databases typically offer schema flexibility, allowing developers to store data without a predefined schema. This enables easier adaptation to changing data requirements.\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are often designed for horizontal scalability, meaning they can efficiently distribute data across multiple servers to handle large volumes of data and high throughput.\n",
    "Eventual Consistency: Many NoSQL databases relax ACID properties in favor of eventual consistency, where data consistency is achieved after a certain period, allowing for greater scalability and performance.\n",
    "Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase, Neo4j."

    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define and manage the structure of database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and schemas. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete these objects within a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of some common DDL statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects such as tables, indexes, views, or schemas. It defines the structure of the object being created along with any initial settings or constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    FirstName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    LastName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    DepartmentID INT\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP: The DROP statement is used to delete existing database objects such as tables, indexes, views, or schemas. It removes the object and its associated data from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER: The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of existing database objects. It can be used to add, modify, or drop columns, constraints, or indexes from tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "ADD COLUMN Email VARCHAR(100);\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all rows from a table, effectively resetting the table's data while keeping its structure intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\n",
    "This SQL statement removes all rows from the \"Employees\" table, but the table structure remains unchanged."
